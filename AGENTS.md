# AgentLayer — Agent Guidelines

These guidelines apply to AI coding agents modifying or extending the AgentLayer repository.

## Core Rules

1. **Smallest Correct Change**: Always prefer the most focused, minimal change that achieves the goal.
2. **Inspect First**: Inspect existing work and understand the context before modifying or adding files.
3. **No Unnecessary Abstractions**: Do not introduce abstractions, wrappers, or speculative patterns without a concrete, current requirement.
4. **Preserve Working Components**: Do not rewrite or refactor working code or content unnecessarily.
5. **Keep Skills Focused**: Each skill must address a single domain or task cleanly.
6. **Avoid Rule Duplication**: Do not duplicate universal rules across individual skills; place universal principles in `instructions/`.
7. **Preserve Repository Structure**: Do not silently reorganize, add unplanned top-level directories, or alter the repository structure without explicit instruction.
8. **Verify Before Completion**: Verify all changes, file paths, and syntax before declaring work complete.
9. **No False Claims**: Never claim tests or verification passed unless they were genuinely executed and verified.
10. **Preserve Attribution & Licensing**: Always maintain upstream licensing information, references, and attribution for any adapted material in `sources/SOURCES.md`.

## Smart Router Guidelines

11. **Test-Backed Routing Rules**: Never add a routing rule or trigger without a corresponding test scenario in `tests/router/scenarios.json`.
12. **Register Only Real Skills**: Never register nonexistent skills or placeholders as production-ready in `routing/registry.json`.
13. **Precise Triggers Over Broad Keywords**: Prefer specific technology and capability triggers over generic terms that cause over-selection.
14. **Avoid Domain Over-Selection**: Do not route every domain task to every domain skill; select only the minimal, highest-confidence tools.
15. **Concrete Reasons for Dependencies**: Hard dependencies (`requires`) and recommendations (`recommended`) must have explicit, documented rationales.
16. **Deterministic Execution**: The router must produce the identical skill composition and ordering for identical inputs across all runs.
17. **Regression Testing for Routing**: Any modification to scoring, classification, or registry metadata must pass the entire `npm run test:router` suite with 100% scenario accuracy.
